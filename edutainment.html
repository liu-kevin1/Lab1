    <h2>An Introduction to the Usage of Games in Education</h2>

    <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>

    <p>
        &emsp;The usage of games as an alternate medium 
        for education is an approach that should
        be followed more. There have already been a multitude
        of studies on it:

                <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220663815_Teachers'_Views_on_the_Approach_of_Digital_Games-Based_Learning_within_the_Curriculum_for_Excellence">
                    <strong><em>The use of Games-Based Learning Within
                the Curriculum for Excellence: The Teacher's Perspective</em></strong></a>
                describes work in Scotland which has been transforming
                education towards a new approach that appeals to what,
                how, and where young people learn. It is known as the
                Curriculum of Excellence (CfE), and is being implemented
                in secondary schools after being developed in primary 
                schools.

                    <strong><em>Designing Serious Games for Education:
                From Pedagogical Principles to Game Mechanisms</em></strong></a>
                focuses on the effects that Serious Games have on players.
                Serious Games are games where the focus is not for 
                entertainment but rather for another primary purpose, 
                such as educating the player on topics like military 
                situations, scientific explorations, emergency 
                management, and engineering.

                    <strong><em>Utilising an Educational Framework for the
                Development of Edutationment Scenarios</em></strong></a>
                elaborates on a structure which can be used for 
                creating and operating educational games. It focuses 
                on combining human-computer communication,
                interaction/educational design, entertainment studies 
                and practical approaches to game development in order to
                create custom edutainment scenarios.
