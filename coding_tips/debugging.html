            Search StackOverflow
        </li>
        <li>
            Take a short snack break and come back to it later. You might not find the problem, but at least you won't be as hungry.
        </li>
        <li>
            Draw it out on a whiteboard and figure out the program flow

            Search GitHub
        </li>
        <li>
            Change random things in the code and keep running it. It might work one of the few dozen times you try it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Try and get something else working and then call it a day. (3. Bargaining)

        <li>
            Look at cat pictures
